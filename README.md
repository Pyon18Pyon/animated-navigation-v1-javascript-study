# animated-navigation-v1-javascript-study

This project was completed as part of the Udemy course, [JavaSrcipt Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/). 
The main focus on this project is to create a navigation for a Web site that has some advanced CSS animations.

## What it does?

If we click on the hamburger button, we can launch and see that all of the NAV items are sliding in one by one. And when we close it, they slide out one by one as well.
This navigation is also mobile responsive.
